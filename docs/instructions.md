**Steps:**

NOTE: Python 2.7 must be installed and this is a windows only app. We will be adding cross-platform libraries later.

1. Open command line and Run *pip install -r requirements.txt* or *python setup.py install* to install dependencies.
2. Change directory to Project home.
3. Save your picture in home/src/images named as your_name.jpg
4. Run *python init.py*.
5. Continue as directed by the program.
